# Project Overview

In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. We will use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

# Running the project

Clone the repository [https://github.com/chanelaine/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader] and open the index.html file in your browser. The tests will be located at the botton of the page.
